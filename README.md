**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

As a consultant for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), we are working with a new client called, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room is looking to develop a web-based game that will cross over into multiple platforms based off their current game, Draw It or Lost It. This app is currently available only on Android. This game will have teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The app will choose from a library of stock images as the clues. The game consists of four rounds, which last one minute each. The drawings are rendered steadily until they complete at the 30-second mark. If the current team does not guess the puzzle before the times up the opposing team will have the opportunity to guess with an additional 15 seconds.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I was able to figure out more of the hardware ascpects of the software design document on my own since I already have an IT-Background. I was also able to keep this design document structured in a way that made sense according to our requirements.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

I found the part about the domain model and system architecture most helpful. The domain model section really helps breakdown different classes and gets you to think about how the program will overall be structured. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise my evaluation section. While it seemed that it should have been intuitive as to what tools we were supposed to use in this project it really wasn't. It would really take me doing another day or two of research but  I really wanted to nail down exactly what we would need to build this product to the customers absolute satisfcation. I appreciate our professors help in getting us on the right track and making sure that we have a software design document that we can use for the future. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

Interpreting the user's needs takes a bit of experience and great listening ability. You have to read between the lines and have enough expertise to actually provide solutions to the user's problem. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing software since they are the end user's. If you want to stay in business and even just morally... it is the right thing to do to provide the best possible product when someone is paying for it.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I utilized psuedocode and UML diagrams to help me write this program. I would also in the future continue to utilize psuedocode and UML diagrams when designing a similar application.
